Make it so that the minimax function has a certain time,
first searches at depth 1, then 2, then 3, etc.

Add alpha beta pruning
W/o alpha beta pruning, at a depth of 7, minimax was called 80,565 times
W/ alpha beta pruning, at a depth of 7, minimax was called 28,618 times.

Add a cache that stores positions already evaluated
Make sure to also store the depth at which they were calced so that evaluations
at that depth or lower can just steal that data
