        I made this bot in early 8th grade after losing our homeroom's Connect 4
        tournament. My science teacher started making fun of meâ€¦
        <br /><b>He had to pay.</b>

      <p class="section-info">
        This is a simple Connect 4 bot that uses minimax. It stores the board
        position in an array. Later, I tried a TypeScript version with 64-bit
        integers (inspired by
        <a href="http://blog.gamesolver.org/" target="_blank">Pascal Ponsâ€™ C++ version</a>),
        but JavaScript only supports bitwise operations on 32-bit integers.
        <br /><br />
        Arrays still seem to be the best option, and this bot beats all my
        other JS/TS attempts. Enjoy!
