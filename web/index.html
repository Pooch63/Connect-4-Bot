    <h1>Connect 4 Bot</h1>
    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
      I made this bot in early 8th grade. I lost our homeroom's Connect 4
      tournament, and my science teacher started making fun of me.

        <p class="section-info">
          This is a simple Connect 4 bot that uses minimax. It uses an array to
          store the board position. After this bot, I spent a few weeks making a
          totally different one written in TypeScript. I wanted to use 64 bit
          integers to store the board info, like in
          <a href="http://blog.gamesolver.org/">Pascal Pons' C++ version</a>.
          Since you can only use bitwise operations on 32-bit integers in JS (so
          weird, right?), I had to use Bigints.

          <br /><br />

          Yeah, suffice to say, I didn't get very far with that. So, thus far,
          arrays seem to be the way to go, and this bot triumphs over every
          other attempt of mine at a JS/TS bot.
